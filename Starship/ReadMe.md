# Deep Learning
Time management and clean code:
In A1-A3, I started working on assignment several days before deadline, which make me write code quickly to meet requirement. The quality of the code is bad. It is hard to read for the future me, and it cost more time to refactor code. Therefore, I need to start early and write code clear and self-documentation. And it is important to maintain a good daily routine (sleep regularly and take exercise).

Overplanning:
In starship, when I heard the deadline is in the end of the semester, I stop finishing my bonus features and try to think more new and fancy features. I actually have a full plan for a welding system, but I do not have time to do this(or I think I am afraid of starting? I always choose to do other thing first). I postpone starship gold to the last week. due to a fever in the final week, I even start working on starship in the last day. Then I have to quickly cut features, and select several features which can be done in 5 hours, and I am surprised that I actually can code it in time. It may because I have been trained after Libra or my plan on features is clear. 
I want to quote some sentence from [Just Do It Already!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN-Uh2VfL8c) "Do it and Do it now" "If you're feeling unmotivated there's no point in overthinking it. The time is now. Get those hands moving. Motivation will come later"
